The time for finding 1000 words in around 25000 words(otherwise it is not enough memory)


Time with list: 0.1898350715637207 sec
Time with alphabet bst: 1.7092580795288086 sec
Time with random bst: 0.0032088756561279297 sec
Time with rebalanced bst: 0.002178192138671875 sec


As we can see the best time is using rebalanced bst and the worst is with alphabet bst(because the time to find elem is maximum here)
